## What is "The Umbrella Academy"? 

A 10-week course created by [Kelsey Monson](https://github.com/KelseyRMonson) to teach **dry lab** skills to **wet lab** scientists (because an ☔ keeps you dry when it's wet, get it?)

## What is hosted on the GitHub?

Here you will find the code for the hands-on exercises to get students comfortable with these dry lab skills:

* Using the [command line](Command-Line)
* Making plots in [R](R-Project)
* Practicing [debugging and data cleaning](Debugging-Cleaning)
